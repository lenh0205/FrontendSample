# Redux 
* -> a lightweight **state management tool** which can be used with any JavaScript framework or library to maintain a consistent and predictable state container
* -> by **`keeping the state of an application in a single global store rather than at the component level`**
* => each individual component can access any state it needs at any time regardless of the shape of the component tree, as long as it is connected to the store via Redux
