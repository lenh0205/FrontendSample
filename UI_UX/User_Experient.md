# Multi-Page Form
* **Problem**: `long forms`
* -> Sometimes in order to get a site visitor to convert, we need to get `a lot of info` from them
* -> site `visitor may feel annoyed` or get bored by a form that asks them too much info all at once
* =>  `form abandonment` and `low conversion rates`

* **Solution**: 
* -> break form’s parts up into `easier to digest sections`
* -> get better `qualified leads`

* **Qualified leads mean more sales**
* -> By having people go through multiple steps to convert, you know only those really interested in what you have to offer will finish
* -> doesn’t matter how many people complete your site’s form if they don’t turn out to be the kind of person you’re looking for

## Examples:
### Cách 1:
* To start, they make the 1st part of form really **`easy to fill out`** (_basic info such as `name, email, and phone number`_)
* include a question about location, personalizing the next step of the form 
* A "Next" `green action button` -> making it clear to visitors there are additional steps to the form
* `Arrow icon` on the call to action button -> making it clear that there are more steps to complete

### Cách 2:
* have a `bold headline` telling the visitor what to `expect after converting` (_VD: biểu mẫu của 1 trang web như "The better way to manage training & Increase Productivity"_)
* a simple call to `action button` to click (_VD: "Start Free Trial" button_)
* Once a site visitor clicks on the call to action button, the next step of the form appears, which is very simple; It `only asks for an email and a password`
* `Next button` - becomes clear to the converting visitor now that there is another step to complete the form
* => If the visitor has gotten this far, `chances are they’ll finish`, especially after creating a password. 
* => This means they’re a qualified lead interested in the Quick Base free trial
* => This interest has the potential to turn into a monthly recurring payment in the future

### Cách 3: multi-step form to help people sign up for their free 30-day trial.
* like a checkout page, the `steps are outlined above the form` (_VD: nhìn vào site visitors know there are 3 step: The 1st step is creating an account, the 2nd step is attaching social profiles, and the last step is where they can finish signing up and begin using the service_)
* In addition, they `add descriptions to each breadcrumb` so their visitors `know ahead of time` what they’ll need to do to sign up
*  can also `get their email address` to follow-up with them later if they don’t finish using form by `automatically saving partial form entries`
* => If you can get people to create an account, getting them to finish the form is easy
* => because people love consistency and commitment

### Cách 4: strategies when it comes to their signup form
* To start, they offer a `2-step optin landing page`
* `offer a bold call to action` that can’t be ignored by someone who wants to download the free homepage template they’re offering
* Once you click on the call to action button, you’re taken to a `unique popup form` showing 2 steps, thanks to `the progress bar` at the top of the form (_VD: "bạn đã hoàn thành 50%"By clicking on the call to action button on the 1st page, you’ve already completed step 1 of 2 on the landing page_)
*  => it entices leads with the `free download incentive`, and gets those that are truly interested to give their personal info `in exchange for a free download`
