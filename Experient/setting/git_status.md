* **Untracked** basically means that Git sees a file you didn’t have in the previous snapshot (commit), and which hasn’t yet been staged

* **git add** is a _multipurpose command_ - we use it to **`begin tracking new files`**, to **`stage files`**, and to do other things like **`marking merge-conflicted files as resolved`**
* _hiểu đơn giản thì nó để **add precisely this content to the next commit**_

* to begin **tracking new file**, use the command **git add**

* **Staged** - or **`Changed to be committed`** - **`Staging Modified Files`**
